Your space is incredible, our server was attentive and knowledgeable. My problem is that while offering only a limited menu for restaurant week, you were quickly out of one of the additional items offered. We had called in advance to check on menu items and were told of the leg of lamb entree. Since a couple of us love lamb, we were excited to try your version...only to learn that at 7:30 on a Saturday night you were already out of it. Very disappointing! Sorry to be so wordy but I feel (as did all of us) that this was a strike against the restaurant. Thanks for your time."
