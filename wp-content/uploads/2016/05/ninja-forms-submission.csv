There were highs and lows which are to be expected in a new restaurant. I feel if you're not told, you won't know. We were greeted by some pleasant hostesses. There was some confusion about seating and we were displaced and moved, which caused another table to be moved. There was a somewhat uncomfortable interval where we waited for our waiter. His greeting was that of a retail counter worker when he sadi, ""how may i help you"" He was a bit lost after we asked him what types of tye and vodka we had. He offered to go back and find out, but it would've been better if he had a cheat sheet. The Shrimp dumpling app was underwhelming.  I found it to only taste like salt. Paired with the Ponzu it was not a good combination. The Gunther salad was just lettuce and dressing. The high point was the entrees. The grouper and the steak was excellent. The problem was the rhythm of the kitchen. The macaroni and cheese we had ordered didn't come out until we were halfway finished our meal. You all were very accommodating though and helped make our experience good. We loved the atmosphere and will return. I write this hoping it will help you in the future. Thanks"
